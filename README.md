The following steps need to be undertaken in order to recreate the Hospital Management System project. 

Step 1: Installing and Configuring XAMP/WAMP
In order for the project to work, XAMP (MacOS) or WAMP (Windows) needs to be installed. Once done, the hms folder must be added to the directory. In order to do this, 

Step 2: Initializing the Required Servers
From the XAMP/WAMP manager, initialize the MySQL Database and Apache Web servers.

Step 3: Setting up the Database
From the web browser, go to localhost/phpmyadmin/ in order to access the database manager. Here, import the hms_db.sql file attached in this folder. This will recreate the database. 

Step 4: Using the HMS
Once the 3 steps above are successfully completed, the system is ready for use. In order to begin, go to localhost/hms/ in order to begin a session at the login page.

Step 5: Ending Session
Once done, stop the servers from running by controlling their active states in the XAMP/WAMP manager.
